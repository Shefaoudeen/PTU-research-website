    "Novel complex forming acrylate polymers for metal ion recovery (Dr. T. Kaliyappan), DST (Young Scientist Scheme), 7.92 Lahks",
    "Synthesis, Structure and optical properties of polymer gelled photonic crystals by irradiation and non-implantation techniques (Dr. T. Kaliyappan), UGC-DAE CSR, 9.6 Lakhs",
    "Development of novel chelating polymers for the effective sorption of chromium ions from tannery wastes (Dr. T. Kaliyappan), MoEF, 17.3 Lakhs.",
    "Functional chelating polymeric ligands for industrial effluent treatment (Dr.T. Kaliyappan), CSIR, 21.0 Lakhs",
    "Ontology based reactivity modeling system for organic chemicals through a semantic structure markup method (Dr.P.Sankar), DST, 24.25 Lakhs",
  ],

  description2: `The polymer technology oriented research activities involves highly sophisticated instruments, hence are conducted in collaboration with the Central instrumentation facilities Anna University, CLRI, Chennai, IGCAR kalpakkam. The study of reaction modeling is a Computer based virtual modeling, and it does not require any instrumentation facility in the department.`,
