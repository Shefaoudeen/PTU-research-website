  description: `The Department of Physics has been functioning right from the inception of the institution in 1985. The Department initially functioned as a supporting department catering to the demands of the under-graduate students. The Department started a post-graduate course in Material Science and Technology in 1992. The M.Phil. and Ph.D. research programs were begun in 1997. The Department has a well-equipped Physics Laboratory and P.G. Material Science & Technology Laboratory. The laboratories of the department are equipped with state of the art equipment some of which include the following: Flaw Detector, Ultrasonic Magnetic Particle Detector, Eddy Current Detector, Strain analysis Equipment with DAS computer Stand-alone System, Viscometer (milli Pascal to mega Pascal range), Vacuum coating units with Electron Beam Gun, Four-probe, Two-probe Conductivity Measurement Setup, Differential Thermal Analyzer, Thermo Luminescence Set-up, High power Electro Magnet with imported gauss meters to measure axial and transverse magnetic fields, Electronic Balance Micro and Milligram Accuracy, Ball Mill (planetary type), and LCR meter. The department has five highly qualified and experienced faculty members.
